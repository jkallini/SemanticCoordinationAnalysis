At least one prior study by Kessler and colleagues [15], however, using measures of perceived discrimination in a large American sample, reported that approximately 33% of respondents reported some form of discrimination (see also, Gibbons et al. [4]).

The logic is that (nearly) all Wave 4 respondents appeared in the Wave 1 sample, but not all would have been interviewed at Wave 3 due to differential patterns of temporary attrition.

More specifically, when analyzing weighted sample data employing the svy suite of commands in Stata the conventional Pearson χ2 statistic test of independence is converted into “an Fstatistic with noninteger degrees of freedom by using a second-order Rao and Scott (1981 [22], 1984 [23]) correction”. [24]

The p-value associated with the design-based F is thus more accurate (than the associated with the χ2 statistic) given the adjustments and calculations take into account the weighted nature of the data.

As noted earlier, all analyses were weighted according to the survey weight provided by the Add Health research staff and standard errors were corrected for the clustering and stratification that defined the sampling strategy.

All done! The result is stored in test.csv.
